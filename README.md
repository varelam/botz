### Minimalistic scheduler - personal reminders under 3 seconds
Use this bot to write down your reminders in less than 3 seconds. Example:

```!nota My note here sabado```

And there, I scheduled my note for next Saturday (SÃ¡bado in portuguese) and I know I will get reminders for `My note here` on Friday night and on Saturday morning.
All on Discord, that you always check! No Google calendar bullshit, just one simple line.

- You can list all the notes: `!lista`
- Cancel a note by ID: `!cancelar 4`
- And ask for help if you ever forget how it works: `!ajuda`

## Concept
This is my personal scheduling discord bot. It reminds of stuff throughout the week.
Why use Google/Apple/Notion calendars, which offer too much resistance to setting up a reminder, and lack jokes, puns and personality? Never again spend time opening an awkward UI and filling everything.
All the Discord bots out there are also pretty meh, so I made this.

Other useful features (will sooner or later) include:
- set up my daily reminders for Duolingo and music study
- automatically shared calendar with girlfriend on our discord server
- custom daily messages
- persistent notes
